use SparkConf to config

The SparkConf associated with a given application is immutable once it is passed to the SparkContext constructor. That means that all
configuration decisions must be made before a SparkContext is instantiated.

Most logging and instrumentation in Spark is expressed in terms of stages, tasks, and shuffles. Understanding how user code compiles down
into the bits of physical execution is an advanced concept, but one that will help you immensely in tuning and debugging applications.

How to read 4040

Performance tips:
1. control degree of parallelism
2.When Spark is transferring data over the network or spilling data to disk, it needs to serialize objects into a binary format. This comes
into play during shuffle operations, where potentially large amounts of data are transferred.  - use Kryo serilziatioan
-Dsun.io.serialization.extended DebugInfo=true to help debug not serializable exception
3. tweak caching behavior
