f work that goes into conducting successful analyses lies in preprocessing data.  can require computational methods to even discover what
preprocessing steps are required. a typical data pipeline requires spending far more time in feature engineering and selection than in
choosing and writing algorithms.o

Modeling and analysis typically require multiple passes over the same data.

When data scientists are initially investigating and trying to get a feel for a data set, usually the results of a query inform the next
query that should run. When building models, data scientists do not try to get it right in one try. Choosing the right features, picking the
right algorithms, running the right significance tests, and finding the right hyperparameters all require experimentation.

biggest bottleneck in building data applications is not CPU, disk, or network, but analyst productivity.
