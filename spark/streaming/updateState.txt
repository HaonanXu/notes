1. need. enable checkpointing on the streaming context. In local testing mode, it is a local directory, but it should be an HDFS address in
cluster mode

2. updateStateByKey takes a reducer function, which accept a current value and an iterator of values,i.e, current value is the current
state, iterator is the list of new data from the new batch grouped by the key(hence it might be a list instead of a single one)

3. updateStateKey and itself just returns another Stream of k-v pairs. Key is the "byKey", and value "state". This "byKey" requirement also
means the source stream should be a k-v stream as well
