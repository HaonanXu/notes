For tuning:
1. reducing procesing time of each batch of data
2. setting the right batch size s.t. the batches of data can be procesed as fast as they are received

degress of parallelism for receiver
# of blocks in each btach determines # of task that will be used to process the reived data in a map-like tranformation
repartition data into different # of partitions
degree of parallelism in data processing

Use Kry serialization can reduce CPU and memory overheads
case data to be retained is not large


if # tasks launced per sec is high (50 per second), need to reduce that overhead

Check value of the end-to-end delay in "Total delay" in Spark driver log4j, delay should be less than batch size
