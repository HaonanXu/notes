Stream to stream join
-----
2 k-v streams directly joined together, RDD-to-RDD, even though batches have different size.

Stream to dataset 
---
use stream.transform

arbitrary RDD-to-RDD functions, e.g., join every batch in a data stream with another dataset, i.e., do rdd to rdd join(?)

Note that in traditional RDD sense, ByKey ops will trigger a shuffle, which is generally expensive
