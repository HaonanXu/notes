silding window options: 1. window length, 2. sliding interval

all window ops take these 2 parameters

reduceByWindow's function should be associately, returns a single element stream

reduceByKeyAndWindow: accepts reduce function. Unlike updateStateByKey, this reduce is between elements only, instead of between previous
state and new colleciton of elements. This also implies the reduce funtion itself is associative AND invertible

with checkpointing enabled, we can further improve the efficiency by adding an inverse reduce function as elments leaving the slide window
