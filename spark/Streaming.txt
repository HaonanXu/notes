Operations:

repartition: changes the level of parallelism
reduce: function should be associative 
countByValue:
reduceByKey:
join: note that they must be within the same stream batches
cogroup:
When called on DStream of(K,V) and (K,W) pairs, return a new DStream of(K, Seq[V], Seq[W]) tuples

updateStateByKey: state for each key is updated by applying the givne function on the previous state of the key => need to turn on updateStateByKey

transform: rdd to rdd operations, the function provided to tranform is evaluated every batch interval

print(): first ten elements of every batch of data

saveAsTextFiles|ObjectFiles|HadoopFiles

foreachRDD: push the data in each RDD to a external system => problems and patterns
