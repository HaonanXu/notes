aggregator: interface to DB clients and applications
leaves: stores and processes data
Rather than caching results of the query, memsql caches the compiled query plan
it uses MVCC
row store for transactional and analytical workloads
designed for read-commited, but not for serializable concurrency mode
used LLVM for code genration

MemSQL continuously backs up data to disk with transaction logs and periodic snapshots. These features can be tuned all the way from synchronous durability (every write transaction is recorded on disk before the transaction completes) to purely in-memory durability (maximum sustained throughput on writes).

use shard key to decide what partition a row should be in
