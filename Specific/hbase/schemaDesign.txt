no more than 2 column families

avoid hotspotting caused by row key: salting, hashing, reversing the key

avoid monotocially increasing row keys time series because they create hotspot

if row and col names are large => cell value coordinates are large

keep column family names short => one character ideally

short attribute name, short rowkey length as long it keeps semantics

reverse timestamps at the end of key to find the earliest version

support any types that can be turned into bytes

supports counter

time to live deletes current val

secondary index to help query

client request filters: dont do a full can on a large table from an application

row key size:
HashKey to have fixed-size row key

rows vs versions: rows

extremely wide tables: row vs columns: rows
