bucketing: each bucket is a kevy-document criterion => list of buckets, each one with a set of documents that "belong" to it

metric: keep track and compute metris over a set of documents

pipeline: aggregate output of other aggregations and their metrics

single and multi-value aggregation when used as sub-aggregations of some bucket

sum agg example

{
    "query" : {
        "constant_score" : {
            "filter" : {
                "range" : { "timestamp" : { "from" : "now/1d+9.5h", "to" : "now/1d+16h" }}
            }
        }
    },
    "aggs" : {
        "YOUR_AGG_NAME" : { "sum" : { "field" : "FIELD_TO_EXTRACT" } }
    }
}

term aggregation
sum_other_doc_count: sum of the doc counts for all buckets that are not part of the response
buckets: list of the top buckets
by default: terms returns the buckets for the top ten terms order by the doc_count, need to change size param
Note: document counts are approximate

Document count error(!)
