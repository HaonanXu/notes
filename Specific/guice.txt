assisted injetion: auto-generating Factory implementations from simple interfaces

e.g. some of ctor params from injector, and others form the caller

annotate the implementation class's ctor and fields that aren't know by the inector
Then bind a Provicer<Factory> in the Guice module

AssitedInject maps the create() method's params tot he corresponding @AssistedParams in the implementatins class's ctor, For the other
construtoer arguemnts, it asks the regular injector to provide values
