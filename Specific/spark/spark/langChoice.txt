Java: obviously no. Map reduce is functional in nature.

Scala vs Python for your map reduce code?

Scala:
If map reduce code is complex, especially with a lot of logic outside of spark API call. Scala will outperform python by a large margin

Python:
Scala needs to use sbt to package a jar file and send it to worker nodes. Python will execute script directly
Python has much more libraries related to data analysis

Map reduce job is more likely written in scala, but driver program can be written in Python as long as it doesnt do any heavy-lifting
