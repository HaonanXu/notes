DNS can be used for service discovery, but not flexible for constant changing services

basepath/serviceName/instanceID

ServiceProvider: provider stratey to select one instance from a set of instances

need to cache and reuse service provider object

use ServiceProvider.notError() when experience service instance's issues, to mark availablility

pass application's service descriptor to the ServiceDiscovery ctor to auto register/unregister

Can use ServiceCache, which uses Watcher to mark if cache is valid
