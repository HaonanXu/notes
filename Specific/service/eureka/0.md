@EnableEurekaServer
Standing up an instance of the Eureka service registry that other applications can talk to

Spring Cloud will startup a Eureka instance with its Spring Boot auto-configuration. 
Spring Cloud Eureka sample shows how to deploy it in a highly-available configuration.

@EnableDiscoveryClient activates the Netflix Eureka DiscoveryClient implementation. There are other implementations for other service registries like Hashicorp’s Consul or Apache Zookeeper.

Whatever implementation you choose, you’ll soon see the eureka-client registered under whatever name you specify in the spring.application.name property. This property is used a lot in Spring Cloud, often in the earliest phases of a service’s configuration. This property is used in service bootstrap and so by convention lives in eureka-client/src/main/resources/bootstrap.properties where it’s found before src/main/resources/application.properties.

If you are running in the cloud environment, you will need to pass in the java commandline property -Deureka.datacenter=cloud so that the Eureka Client/Server knows to initialize the information specific to AWS cloud.

By default, Eureka client searches for the property file eureka-client.properties in the classpath. It further searches for environment specific overrides in the environment specific properties files. The environment is typically test or prod and is supplied by a -Deureka.environment java commandline switch to the eureka client (without the .properties suffix). Accordingly, the client also searches for eureka-client-{test,prod}.properties.

--------
The properties in the files explain what they are for. At the minimum the following things need to be configured:

Application Name (eureka.name)
Application Port (eureka.port)
Virtual HostName (eureka.vipAddress)
Eureka Service Urls (eureka.serviceUrls)


The easiest way to configure Eureka Server is by using property files similar to the Eureka Client above. First, configure the Eureka client that is running with the server as specified above. Eureka server itself fires up a Eureka Client that it uses to find other Eureka Servers. Therefore, you need to first configure the Eureka Client for the Eureka Server as you would do with any other clients that connect to the Eureka service. The Eureka Server will use its Eureka Client configuration to identify peer eureka server that have the same name (ie) eureka.name

After configuring the Eureka Client, you may need to configure the Eureka Server if you are running in AWS. Eureka server by default searches for property file eureka-server.properties in the classpath.

When running eureka server for local development, there is typically a wait of ~3 minutes until it fulling boots up. This is due to the default server behaviour to search for peers to sync up and retries when it finds no available peers. This wait time can be reduced by setting the property eureka.numberRegistrySyncRetries=0.

In general, it's always safer to have the servers be on a newer version than clients.

The application then can explicitly put the instance for traffic, by turning the instance status to UP.

At Netflix, we also use the OUT_OF_SERVICE status, primarily for taking an instance out of traffic. It is used for easy rollback of deployments of new revisions in case of problems. Most applications create a new ASG for a new revision and the traffic gets routed the new ASGs. In the case of problems, rolling back a revision is just a matter of turning off the traffic by setting all instances in the ASG to OUT_OF_SERVICE.

In AWS cloud, make sure you retry on failures and keep the timeouts low, because there could be scenarios where Eureka server could return instances that no longer exists in the case of outages.

Once the server starts receiving traffic, all of the operations that is performed on the server is replicated to all of the peer nodes that the server knows about. If an operation fails for some reason, the information is reconciled on the next heartbeat that also gets replicated between servers.

Registrations may happen in an orphaned server and some clients may reflect new registrations while the others may not.
