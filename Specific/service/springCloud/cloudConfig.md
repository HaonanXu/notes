To scale the Config Server up and make it highly available, you would need to have all instances of the server pointing to the same repository, so only a shared file system would work. Even in that case it is better to use the ssh: protocol for a shared filesystem repository, so that the server can clone it and use a local working copy as a cache.

This repository implementation maps the {label} parameter of the HTTP resource to a git label (commit id, branch name or tag). If the git branch or tag name contains a slash ("/") then the label in the HTTP URL should be specified with the special string "(_)" instead (to avoid ambiguity with other URL paths). For example, if the label is foo/bar, replacing the slash would result in a label that looks like foo(_)bar.

TODO: Placeholders in Git URI

If you donâ€™t use HTTPS and user credentials, SSH should also work out of the box when you store keys in the default directories (~/.ssh) and the uri points to an SSH location, e.g. "git@github.com:configuration/cloud-configuration"

It is important that an entry for the Git server be present in the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file and that it is in ssh-rsa format

To avoid surprises, you should ensure that only one entry is present in the known_hosts file for the Git server and that it is matching with the URL you provided to the config server. If you used a hostname in the URL, you want to have exactly that in the known_hosts file, not the IP. The repository is accessed using JGit, so any documentation you find on that should be applicable. HTTPS proxy settings can be set in ~/.git/config or in the same way as for any other JVM process via system properties (-Dhttps.proxyHost and -Dhttps.proxyPort).

By default, the JGit library used by Spring Cloud Config Server uses SSH configuration files such as ~/.ssh/known_hosts and /etc/ssh/ssh_config when connecting to Git repositories using an SSH URI.
