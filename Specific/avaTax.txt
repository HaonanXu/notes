For every tax calculation done before a sale is complete, you should use DocType SalesOrder. This will not create a record of the
calculation in AvaTax, so you won't have to do any cleanup for abandoned carts.

When you recognize the sale, make another call to AvaTax with DocType SalesInvoice to record the transaction for reporting. You can commit
the document at this time, or later, depending on your business process. i.e,
1. issue charge on CC
2. issue GetTax with DocType = salesInvoice
3. issue GetTax with Commit = true (??)

The VAT decision process utilizes the BusinessIdentificationNo field of the GetTaxRequest or Line object, which is where you will send the
buyerâ€™s VAT registration ID.

------------
For the majority of cases, however, we recommend that you stub out the AvaTax API calls. This will save you on both the time it takes to run
your unit and integration tests (and non-tax functional tests), and the number of transactions you consume.

In tests where a live tax calculation is required (for example, to check if the service is available or if your credentials are correct),
there is no replacement for an actual call to the API
