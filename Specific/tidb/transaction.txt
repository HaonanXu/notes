1. buffer all update/delete on client side

2. Prewrite primaryRow: 
	a. lock the primaryRow with the start time of current transaction, if there is no other client locking the same primaryRow, and if there is any Write happened during (startTs +inf)
	b. if we can not lock primaryRow, that means there is potental conflict - rollback a

3. Prewrite secondaryRow, follows similar steps of primaryRow, except that the content of the lock is the one for primaryRow

4. commit primary, write to W column new data: startTs at commitTs

5. commit secondaries asychly

During read in transaction:
1. check if the row has L column in [0, startTs] => wait for its timeout or release
2. read W column, in [0, startTs], convert to proper timestamp, and read the column at version timestamp
