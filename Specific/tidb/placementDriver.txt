PD role:
global id generation
global timestamp generation
tikv metadata
routing client

Use etcd for auto-failover, note that etcd is powered by raft too.

All PD state is gathered passively by the heatbeat from TiKV. the coordination command are piggybacked on heatbeat messages to TiKV servers

PD leader is different from the etcd leader!

TSO:physical time + logical time
