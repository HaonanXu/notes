Type introspection: code to inspect other code in the same system or even itself
Reflection: make modifications at runtime by making use of introspection => note introspection may not mean reflection is supported 


Method method = foo.getClass().getMethod("doSomething", null);

method.invoke(foo, null);

JUnit uses reflection to look through class tagged with @Test annotation, and will then call them when runnig the unit test

Often used by other OR mappers toinstantiate objects from databases without knowning in advance what objects they're going to use.
