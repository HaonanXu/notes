1. What to install?
Use Dockerfile to set up dev samsa environment

2.  How To make a samsa job?
You need to make: 
A. a samza package, 
B. a samza job configuration file.

3. What is a samza package?
Just a folder with the following structure

bin/run-am.sh
bin/run-class.sh
bin/run-job.sh
bin/run-container.sh
lib/

The 4 .sh files are from samza and should be included as part of packaging process. Your code should be compiled into JARs and put into lib/

4. What is in the JARs?
The class represents your job processing logic. All your stream processing logic should be in a class that implement org.apache.samza.task.StreamTask interface, and more specifically, its process() method

5. How to implement process() method?
A. read incoming messages from envelope
B. use collector to send output message wrapped in OutgoingMessageEnveloope, whose format is just dual of incoming envelope's
NOTE: do NOT use collector outside process()
C. coordinator
for advanced use

6. Complie your classes into JAR, and put it in a package's lib folder mentioned in 3

7.Now how to make configuration file
see the sample configuration file, at minimum, you need to define:
job.factory.class
job.name
task.class
task.inputs

8. run the job with package and configuration file
$PACKAGE_PATH/bin/run-job.sh \
  --config-factory=samza.config.factories.PropertiesConfigFactory \
  --config-path=$CONFIG_PATH
