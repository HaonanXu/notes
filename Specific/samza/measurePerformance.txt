Problem:
Measure performance of a samza process

Can you solve part of the problem?
only need to measure consumer-producer pair one by one

To devise a new problem, can you drop some condition?
measure consumer with process logic
measure consumer-producer without processing logic,i.e., dummy data

What is the unknown?
the throughput in terms of row count, MB/sec, we are more interested in MB/sec

Have you seen a similar problem with similar unknown?
Program to measure Kafka performance

Can you reuse the problem's result?
we have a good idea of producer/consumer's through put without processing logic
producer: 25MB/sec each partition

Can you reuse the problem's method?
check how they measure physical size throughput
double mbSec = msgsSec * (recordSize + Records.LOG_OVERHEAD) / (1024.0 * 1024.0);
because we get a byte array, we can know how much time it takes
