Testing Amazon Aurora Using Fault Injection Queries
--------------
You can force a crash of an Amazon Aurora instance using the ALTER SYSTEM CRASH fault injection query.

For this fault injection query, a failover will not occur. If you want to test a failover, then you can choose the Failover instance action for your DB cluster in the RDS console, or use the failover-db-cluster AWS CLI command or the FailoverDBCluster RDS API action.
