ou configure MariaDB replication based on global transaction identifiers (GTIDs) if the external instance is MariaDB 10.0.2 or greater and the target instance is Amazon RDS MariaDB; otherwise, you configure replication based on binary log coordinates. We recommend GTID-based replication if your external database supports it due to its enhanced crash-safety features

You can use the mysqldump utility to create a database backup in either SQL or delimited-text format. You should do a test run with each format in a nonproduction environment to see which method minimizes the amount of time that mysqldump runs.

Before you start the backup operation, you must set the replication options on the MySQL or MariaDB database that you are copying to Amazon RDS. The replication options include enabling binary logging and setting a unique server ID. Setting these options will cause your server to start logging database transactions and prepare it to be a replication master later in this process.

Your database needs to be stopped to set the replication options and be in read-only mode while the backup copy is created, so you need to schedule a maintenance window for these operations.
