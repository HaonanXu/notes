the Connector => generating the set of Tasks and indicating to the framework when they need to be updated.

A Kafka Connect cluster consists of a set of Worker processes that are containers that execute Connectors and Tasks

Kafka Connect does require persistent storage for offset data to ensure it can recover from faults, and users will need to configure this storage.

In distributed mode, you start many worker processes using the same group.id and they automatically coordinate to schedule execution of
connectors and tasks across all available workers. 

interaction with a distributed-mode cluster is via the REST API. To create a connector, you start the workers and then make a REST request
to create a connector 

Kafka Connect workers do not have a special “leader” process that you have to interact with to use the REST API; all nodes can respond to REST requests, including creating, listing, modifying, and destroying connectors.
