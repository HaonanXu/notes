most likely need to execute on a Kafka COnnect cluster.

 The default unit of work should be an entire database

Support copying to and from both streaming and batch-oriented systems.

 Kafka Connect manages the Tasks; the Connector is only responsible for generating the set of Tasks and indicating to the framework when
they need to be updated.

A Kafka Connect cluster consists of a set of Worker processes that are containers that execute Connectors and Tasks

, Kafka Connect performs broad copying by default by having users define jobs at the level of Connectors which then break the job into
smaller Tasks. 

The REST interface for managing and monitoring jobs makes it easy to run Kafka Connect as an organization-wide service that runs jobs for
many users. 

In distributed mode, you start many worker processes using the same group.id and they automatically coordinate to schedule execution of
connectors and tasks across all available workers. 

interaction with a distributed-mode cluster is via the REST API. To create a connector, you start the workers and then make a REST request
to create a connector 

Need to set: 
1.group.id
2.config.storage.topic: Kafka topic to store connector and task config state
3.offset.storage.topic: the Kafka topic to store connector offset state in. Should have large # of partitons (25 or 50)

To introduce new parameter, add it to $CLASSPATH
