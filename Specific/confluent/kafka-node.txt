how is producer.on('ready', cb) registered?

when to use new to create object with information?

it creates a client, and then pass the client to producer/consumer

 So if you call require('./foo'), both a 'foo.js' file as well as an 'foo/index.js' file will be considered

 always use capital letter for objects that are supposed to be instantiated by the new keyword.
