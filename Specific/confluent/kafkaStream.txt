Kafka Streams is not a RM, but a lib that "runs" anywhere its stream processing app runs

each data record in Kafka Streams is associated with a timestamp

Kafka Streams’ default timestamp extractor will read the timestamp field embedded in the new Kafka message protocol

-------
num.standby.replicas: active-passive
num.stream.threads:
replication.factor: internal topics that KS creates when local stes are used or a stream is repartitioned for aggregateion
timestamp.extractor:

The default extractor is WallclockTimestampExtractor. This extractor does not actually “extract” a timestamp from the consumed record but
rather returns the current time in milliseconds from the system clock, which effectively means Streams will operate on the basis of the
so-called processing time of events.

If you want your data to be processed based on event time, then you must provide your own implementation of the TimestampExtractor interface
to extract the time(stamp) information embedded in your data records.
