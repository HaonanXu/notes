logger name and hierarchy

logger config level: max level the event can pass through, i.e., WARN would allow INFO but but ERROR

appender: output destination

Appenders are inherited additively from the LoggerConfig hierarchy

Each enabled logging request for a given logger will be forwarded to all the appenders in that Logger's LoggerConfig as well as the Appenders
of the LoggerConfig's parents. 

Every configuration must have a root logger.
