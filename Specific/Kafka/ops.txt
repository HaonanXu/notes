load: about 200 mil messages
physical size: 36G inside storage, probably compressed, esitmate 100G during network transfer
total network cost alone, assume 25 m/s transfer rate =
100G * (# publishes + # subscribes) / 25 * # instances

e.g., 1 publish, 1 subscribe, 5 instances => around 30 mins transfer time alone, replication factor=2 will further delay that

best case: same # of Spark nodes and kafka datanodes => best case of parallelism

LinkedIn's kafka cluster: dual quard core Xeon with 24G of memory + 8 * 7200 rpm SATA drives
