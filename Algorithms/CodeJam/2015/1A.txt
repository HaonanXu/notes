all Bs will operate at full capacity
1B Cs, 1k Bs, each takes 100k mins to cut

when is the time that processed + being process = N or N - 1

log2 (100KB) = log2 (100 * (10^3)* (10^9)) = 10 + 30 + 7 = 47 probes

each check cost = 1K * 47 => 47 * 47 => total less than 2.5 mil

so for each probe
	calculate processed + being processed + # of open slotes

if processed + being processed + # of open slots(total) < N => need to do more
if  total == N there we go
if total > N
	if calc processed + being proceesed >= N => too big
	< N => there we go

so max time = #C * 100k

invalid + valid

------------
for each set,
gscan
update max set size number
