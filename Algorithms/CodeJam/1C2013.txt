A:
# of substrings with m consecutive non-vowels => nlogn max

for each index i
	if (i...i+m) is good
		return N-i+m
	else
		find next good block starts
		return N - start -3

B:
trick. notice it doesnt matter which + or -, the parity will remain same. Since it is hard to break down into steps, we consider them together!
so we know
1+...N >= |x| + |y|
1+...N is same parity as |x| + |y|
proof: the condition is satisfied after each move, notice the first inequality case
