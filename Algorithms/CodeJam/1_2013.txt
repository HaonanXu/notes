n black rings

radius = (r-1) + 2n

cost = radius^2 - (radius-1)^2 = 2*radius + 1

=> closed form

sorted by size

1st one,
need to add size - 1, repeating 
i.e, at each step, 
if can eat: eat
if not, 
inserting, each one increases size - 1 vs deleting the remaining, choose the cheaper one
NOte, if we delete the one, we will have the size problem as well, so we need to delete all.

--------------

find # of substrings with at least 3 consecutive consonatns
consider the bands of consecutives
*b*b*b

for each i
if i, i+1, i+2 are all consonant
	num += N - i - 2
else
	Get next band starts
	num += N - nextstart - 2
