notice that flipping bits are independent. Also, if we have a solution, no
more than half of the bits are flipped, i.e., at most 20 flipped in the
solution
for each bit column, if #0s and #1s are different, we know for sure to flip or not
if they are same....

or think horizontally
find the mapping for source i to target j => 150^2 choices
for each choice, we can infer a flipping order, verify this flipping
order,i.e.,

for each mapping
	get fillping order
	for each row
		apply map to row
		if mapped is occupied, error
		else marked as mapped

total cost will be 150*150*40

--------
in a FBT, 1 node with deg 2, s with deg 3, s+1 with degree 1

for each level
	leaf node: delete obvious nos, so its parent has degree at most 3

	for all degree 2 nodes
	if parent is 2 as well, delete current one's and its child,update degree
	leave deg three untouched
	add current parent to next level

--------
One way is to generate many permutations, check its distribution of "scores"

Why is standard algo good?
Why is "swap with all" bad?

another approach: naive bayes classifier
