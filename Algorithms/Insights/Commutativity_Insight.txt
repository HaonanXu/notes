1. if the order of operations doesnt affect the final result(may change the actual solution, but doesnt change the answer to the question we are looking for)
then we can reorder the ops in the way convenient to us. 

2.This may mean searching in an easy to code way,e.g., we can search row by row, or in an sorted order (from min to max)
e.g. in an acyclic graph, we can force the search in topological order, so we can mark the part as searched without worrying about its dependency
this is one insight behind SCC algorithm

3. More importantly, our forced order can mean the partial search solution meets additional constraints,
and we are extending the partial solution/inspecting next part of the search space, we can do less work knowing our partial solution is there already.

Know that "partial solution" may not be we do maintain an actual solution, it may also mean that knowing we have search previous elements according to our order
