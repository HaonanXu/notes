1. log: quickly compute large power or hard to compute power, especially if we dont need precise number.
Another use of that is dealing with small double multipllications, this can avoid a lot of underflow problems, espeically important in probability calculations

2. inversion index: how many swaps it needs to sort an array => relation to merge sort and proof

4. base number is about representation. It doesnt affect the arithmetic properties
