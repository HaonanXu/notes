1. log: quickly compute large power or hard to compute power, especially if we dont need precise number.
Another use of that is dealing with small double multipllications, this can avoid a lot of underflow problems, espeically important in probability calculations

2. inversion index: how many swaps it needs to sort an array => relation to merge sort and proof

3. A "corner case" may or may not be gracely handled by the general case. Sometimes, it may be the base case of the recursion.
Need to analyze it on a case-by-case basis

4. base number is about representation. It doesnt affect the arithmetic properties

5. curIndex - length you want to skip = start index of that subarray you want to skip
similarly start of index + length = start index of the new subarray

9. mid point index of array = length/2
