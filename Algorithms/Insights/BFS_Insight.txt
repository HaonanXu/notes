1. can be used for shortest path of all edges are unit length

2. when we are expanding, we may or may not need a new queue, depending on the problem

3. pseudo code

curDist
//populate all seeds

LP(dist, 0, max)
{
	nextDist
	for each seed in curDist
	{
		if seed is target
			return dist
		
		Try expand seed //mark visited inside
		insert expanded into nextDist
	}

	replace curDist with nextDist
}
