1. The most common use of DFS is to traverse the DP state graph: the top-down DP approach
Conversely, if you can create a acyclic graph of states <=> a recurrence relationship exists

But DFS may have stack overflow problem. In those cases, need to use the bottom up approach

2. DFS can be used to find cycles, but if we know each node has only one out edge,e.g., 
tree in reverse direction, flyod's cycle finding algorithm is better

3. relatedly algorithm:
topological sort, which leads to strongly connected graphs algorithm

4.For graph traversal, the key is to identify potential max number of nodes to decide if it is feasible to apply DFS.
A node may be a combinition of identity states to represent the state of the system
