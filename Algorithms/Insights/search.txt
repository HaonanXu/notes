search direction matters a lot, even 2 sides of the equation, decide look from which side can greatly affect insight and implementation
difficulty. Have to try both before settling on one(!!!),e.g., beginning of action/end of action, LHS/RHS.  This change of search direction is
often useful in solving problem differently, similar to "swap unknown with part of data" idea.

------
similarly, if we have a list of variables, we can impose an order of them so the search space will be limited by the extreme values =>
because other variables will be infered, one by one, perhaps recursively

--------
When search space is small enough, instead of finding a closed form, we can just brute force search. This is a common step as part of
problem

----
Since we are searching for unknown, almost always worth a try to look at unknowns, and try to infer some traits/properties of unknowns
