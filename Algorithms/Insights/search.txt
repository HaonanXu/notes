search direction matters a lot, even 2 sides of the equation, decide look from which side can greatly affect insight and implementation
difficulty. Have to try both before settling on one

similarly, if we have a list of variables, we can impose an order of them so the search space will be limited by the extreme values =>
because other variables will be infered, one by one, perhaps recursively
