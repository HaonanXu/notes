1.direct apporach: bitset/simple dictionary but implementation is often too slow, due to the 2^n number of substes

2. we either have to work with set INDIRECTLY => keep tracking of properties without knowing the exact content in set
	or need a reduction on insight so we no longer deal with set direclty, often, this means deals the content of set organized in a continous way instead of holed way.

3.Because set has the commutativity property, all commutatitivy insight can be used.
