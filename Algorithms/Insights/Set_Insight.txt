1.options:
	bitset/simple dictionary
	if it involves set operation, brute force implementation is often too slow.	
	i.e. we either have to work with set INDIRECTLY => keep tracking of properties without knowing the exact content in set
	or need a reduction on insight so we no longer deal with set direclty

2.Because set has the commutativity property, all commutatitivy insight can be used.
