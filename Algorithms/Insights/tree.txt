1. often need to reconstruct the tree from the string rep first

2. when inspecting the problem, a BFS might give more insight than DFS. 
The key of expanding is that finding the continuous subproblem, i.e., the slibling wont affect the part of solution. So that we can start applying recursion

3. adding any edge to a connected tree will yield a cycle

4. Heap is a special form of tree => it is packed so can be reprsented as an array

5. common tactics: start from root, start from leaves

every time you see only 1 incoming or outgoing edge. This suggests a tree
