1. often need to reconstruct the tree from the string rep first

2. when inspecting the problem, a BFS might give more insight than DFS. 
The key of expanding is that finding the continuous subproblem, i.e., the slibling wont affect the part of solution. So that we can start applying recursion

3. adding any edge to a connected tree will yield a cycle
