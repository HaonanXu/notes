curIndex - length you want to skip = start index of that subarray you want to skip
similarly start of index + length = start index of the new subarray

mid point index of array = length/2

array (1-d or 2-d) is often used in table-driven design, i.e., find matching conditions by pre-populating a table, then computation can be
done as , perhaps repeated, table lookup
