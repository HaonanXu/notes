log: quickly compute large power or hard to compute power, especially if we dont need precise number.
Another use of that is dealing with small double multipllications, this can avoid a lot of underflow problems, espeically important in probability calculations

base number is about representation. It doesnt affect the arithmetic properties

pattern: a group of homogeous types, what can we infer from them, collectively?
