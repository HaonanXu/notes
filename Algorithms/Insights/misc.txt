log: quickly compute large power or hard to compute power, especially if we dont need precise number.
Another use of that is dealing with small double multipllications, this can avoid a lot of underflow problems, espeically important in probability calculations

base number is about representation. It doesnt affect the arithmetic properties

when assertion, if something, organize code so that variables involved in that statement is immediately changed ->  to avoid double-couting
and infinite loop
