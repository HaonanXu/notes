1.
most patterns can be seen in lower dim case, however, we may not be able to reuse the pattern directly. One common cause is that a unit value is often split into two values when going 1 dimension up. This means we have to search all related combos related to that lower-dim value

2. options.
	1.maintain relationship: similar relationship, except each part has multiple dimensions instead of one
	2.maintain entity: Each part still handles simple dimensions, but we have multiple layers of relationship, and layers cycles through dimensions

3.Often need to view the dimension breakdown in different orders to gain additional insight

4. To carry over insight from lower dimension to uppoer dimension, our lower dimension insight needs to be abstract enough to hide all lower-dimension specific detials
