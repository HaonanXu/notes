Multi-dimenstion/multi-part problem:

From problem solving heuristics perspective,  We need to decompose the problem. Note that we decompose to get INSIGHT , NOT direct answers
1. what problem can you recall 
normally a same problem in lower dimension

2. keep the unknown and change data/condition?
Separate part of conditions: 
fix a dimension, how will other dimensions get affected to reach the solution?

This can be linked to our insight in 1). Then we can probably do a complete search on that
