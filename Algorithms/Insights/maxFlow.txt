augmenting path and backflow

max flow/min-cut

remove a min-weighted set of edges in such a way that a given node is unreachable from another given node

implementation with BFS, DFS, and PFS

O(N^3) run time

techinques: super-source and super-sink

in-vertex and out-vertex

given the in and out degress of the vertices of a directed graph. Find the edges

Have min-cut with min # of edges

Given an undirected grpah, what is the min # of edgs that should be removed to disconnect the graph?
What is the min # of vertices that should be remoed to disconnect the graph?

Maximum Bipartitite Matching
