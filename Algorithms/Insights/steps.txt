steps are common associated with inducitons. This means, each of your step should aim to preserve the inductive properties

even iterative steps can be tackled with inductive approach,i.e., if you find you need to repeat some steps, sign that you ve reached
another step in the inductive process

------
If you keep repeating the same steps onto the result of the previous group, either you end up with identity or extreme values, or in a cycle. 

examples of repeating simple step until unable to:

gaussian elimination
bellman-ford
Floyd-cycle finding

------
steps is a common way to decompose the problem, by exploiting the duality of state and changes. Almost always worth a try, even for the completeness of the argument

----
At each step, our step design is around what state should be carries over to the next step. At the same time, which part of current state can be discarded
