steps are common associated with inducitons. This means, each of your step should aim to preserve the inductive properties. This suggests

1. when you have an initial state (known), you can infer the properties of the initial state, and design your step to preserve it. Note as
with induction, key is how strong/general the inductive step is. 

2.Note to preserve the pattern of states, you often have to devise your steps to convert post step state into a new state with our inductive
pattern, i,e, consciously doing reduction into our known patterns

------
If you keep repeating the same steps onto the result of the previous group, either you end up with identity or extreme values, or in a cycle. 

examples of repeating simple step until unable to:

gaussian elimination
bellman-ford
Floyd-cycle finding

------
steps is a common way to decompose the problem, by exploiting the duality of state and changes. Almost always worth a try, even for the completeness of the argument

----
To help recognize patterns, each step should be as SMALL as possible, so that we can break down to fine-grained states,i.e., instead of
trying to dive deeper, at each step, we can/should pause to try to designate a newly state first.

The drawback of this approach is, of course, we will end up with a lot of distinct states, even though some of them may share even deeper
connection and can be simplified.

----
At each step, our step design is around what state should be carries over to the next step. At the same time, which part of current state can be discarded
