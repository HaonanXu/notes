1. sorting is immediately assoicated with bsearch, 
but one potential problem is that bsearch we need to specify the range of bsearch carefully if our element of interest may be in the range

2.another insight is that difference between neighbor < difference between ends, 
we can gradually narrow down the range of interval to find value of interest

3. If order doesnt matter,e.g., operation related to set, sorting can provide a forced order easy to work on

as long as we have a monotonic function, bsearch becomes a possible solution

Sorting is , of course, closely related to extreme values as well, since often in greedy/optimization solutions we naturally have interest
in some form of extreme value
