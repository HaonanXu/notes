1. Sum[i...j] = partialSum[j] - partialSum[i- 1]

2. this minus relationship can be connected to a sorted array, using the fact that difference between ends > difference between neighbors
and O(n) search to narrow down scope

3. An array of N means at most n partial sums mod n => mod triggers a pighole principle insight => so two partial sums will have same mod or one is mod 0

4. for subarrays, a common way to break down the problem is the subarray ending at index i
