Common problem solving heuristics with counting problems:

1. decomposing the problem: change unknown and data, keep the condition
consider an instance within the solution space, and the generation/filtering process. Since steps can be represented as * , and categories +,
i.e., we are not interested in number any more, just the insight within the build process

------
1. most combinatorical counting are recursive/DP in nature, but when we break down the problem, often we need to include the "cushion" as part of subproblem, relationship
