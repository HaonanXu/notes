Rule of style:
have something to say
if have two things to say, dont say them at the same time

The most important signs of progress are heuristic
follow but keep eyes open, trust but look

Signs of progress
analogous problem
if one more datatum is connected with the unknown
another clause of the condition is taken into account
understanding clearly the nature of the unknown
Dispose data so that we can easily recall

If A then B?
B true, A more credible
B false, A false

specializaiton: often useful in the solution of problems
Could you imagine a more accessible related problem? A more special problem? => This specialized auxilary problem is much less ambitious
Could you reuse this problem, probalby with auxiliary element introduced? => reduction into this less ambitious axilary problem

Speiclaization also useful in testing solution

The intelligent reader desires to see that the present step of the argument is correct and the purpose of the present step

Variation:
We are easily tired by intense concentration upon the same point. To keep attention alive, the object on which it is directed must unceasingly change
May need to set ourselves a new quesiton about the problem => varying the original problme to introduce a more accessible auxiliary problem
Test result by variation

Who understands ill, answers ill => Think on the end before you begin <=> Order of carrying out plan is frequently the revers of the order of invention
