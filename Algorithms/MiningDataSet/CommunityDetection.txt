Plan:
Given a model, generate the network. Then given the network, find the "best" model. Models will have set of parameters we  use to evaluate

AMG:
generative model B(V,C,M, {Pc}), for each pair of nodes in community A, we connect htem with prob. Pa
Overal edge probability P(u, v) =
----------
FuA: the membershp strengh of node u to community A.
PA(u,v) = 1 - exp(-FuA * FvA) => Community membershp strenght matrix F(Nodes * Communities)
Generate P(u,v) from PA(u,v)
P(u,v) = 1 - exp(-Fu dotProduct FvT)

-----
Given a network G(V, E), estimate F that maximized the likelihood of:
we use log-likelihood to make numeric error small
Gradiant descant
Compute a gradient of a single row Fu of F

Coordinate gradient ascent: but slow

improvement and why it works
