partiton function and combiner

Tools for sync:
Bring parital result together
Sort order of intermediate keys
partitioner
preserving state in mappers and reducers, but dont forget to emit data on close, i.e., keep the preserve state across k-v pairs. Map/reduce
methods need to consult with the state. basically doing what combiner does by hand. although watch out for memory management and
order-dependent bug

Avoid object creation
Avoid bufferring: limited heap size, won't scale for large dataset

Reduce intermediate data via local aggregation. Can also use combiner

Example: term co-occurence maxtrx for text collction

approach 1: pair apporach: each mapper takes a sentance
approach 2: strips: each mapper takes a sentence
