Scenario: handle short time bursts. After 30 mins, the traffic falls off

But merging the delta into base will affect I/O performance => merge alternatively between zones

during merge, no business traffic, only event log and paxos votes

recommend 5 servers, each with 192 GB

write log and replicated to quorums, means the write log is successful

=> full text search:
search past history based on keywoard

if daily merge zone crashed: manually trigger the merge and release the memory

normally log disk is different from the data disk

synchronous replication - redolog done by paxos

use two level LSM tree

non-blocking 2PC

native multi-tenancy

logic id to physical address is stored in a table. Shard migration only need to update mapping

updateserver on 32 cores easily reaches 300k TPS

updateserver take turns to merge

Oceanbase is a multi-active system, instead of active-passive, client will detect master change and connect to the new one

such alternative also means you can swtich traffic easily for grey update

each cluster has only 1 update server, redo log synced to updateServers quoroms between zones

data mirror verification 
1. all updateserver memtable should be consistent
2. verification of memtable is in the redo log too
