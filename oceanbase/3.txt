Non-partitioned table will fall into one server

can be partitioned with either hash partition or key partition. This is defined during table creation time

insert, replace, select, update, delete need to include partition list in their where clause

support max 8192 paritions

partition by range: we also define # of paritions in PARTITION BY RANGE clause
later can use ALTER TABLE to add new paritions that is BEYOND currently defined ranges. Obviously parition columns can not be NULL

partition by hash: 

only read-commited isolation level is supported at the moment
