NoSQL style:
key/value pair
big table
document
graph
-----
Optimize read query performance:
e.g. comments page
1. Comments
	user name
	country
2. comments
	product
	all comments with user name and countery

so force user name unchangable to reduce write cost
------
e.g. get comments counts for user
do you need a comment count by user table?
what if mutilple comments created by user a thte same time
transaction issue?

--------
# counts by product table: write contention?
=> sharding
query & count up to N entries on N-shards
then sum values to get count

So when we write, we just update 1 shard
-------
Documents-oriented database: mongo db
key ->value(JSON), No idea of schema

changes in spring config and code
-----
Dynamo DB: backed by SSD, can allocate read/write per sec
annotations changes in spring

Create Vidoes, 
Hash key +range key: composite key combined create an overall unique key
or hash key has to be unique

@DynamoDBHashKey
@DynamoDBAutoGenerateKye
getId(); //Hash attribute name

@DynamoDBAttribute
public String getName()
{
	return name;
}
