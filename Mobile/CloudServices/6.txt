why is user/pw/session model not ideal for mobile
-------
OAuth
-finer control of resources
-remove access to individual apps
-change pass w/o revoke access to apps
-doesnt require user/pass to app

Architecture
Resource Server
Authorization Server
Client
Resource Ower/User

Dynamics:
1. User gives name/pw to client
2.Client posts to AS for token /oauth/token, in the request body
with name, pw, client id, grant type (=password), scopes

In https
Authtorization
Basic username:password (client_id and empty string, as per protocol required)


3. SA returns token to client
4. POST /video with Autherization header
Authorization: Bearer token
5. AS will check the token and request to decide access
-----

When client and service are built by us

1. cleint sens password grant to AS
2. AS returns token to client
3. Use the token to go through token and access RS

AS is a controller in sprint security
spring filter checks token
controllers can have security restirciton based on oauth
