Shingling: convert documets etc to sets
Minhashing:large sets to short signatures
Locality-sensitive hashing: on pairs of signatures likely to be similar

Doc -> Shingling -> set of strings of length k that appear in the document -> minhashing -> short integer vectors that represent the
sets, and reflect their similarity -> LSH -> candidate pairs: those pairs of
sigs that we need to test for similarity

k-shingle/gram: sequence of k chars that appears in the doc => represent doc
with set of singles

Can hash long shingle to token => represent a doc by its tokens
