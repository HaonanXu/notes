Graph data: PageRank, Community detection, spam detection

Search challenge: who to "trust". no single right answer to query

Link analysis approach for computing importances of nodes in a graph.

---------
Incoming link as votes => links from important pages are more important

Each link's vote is porportional to the importance of its course page => split among importance/n votes => the page itself is defined this way as well

so force sum of all ranks = 1 to solve the linear system

-----
Stochastic adjacency matrix M: columns sum to 1

Rank vector r: so r = M * r,i.e., r is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 1

How to solve eigenvector? power iteration
