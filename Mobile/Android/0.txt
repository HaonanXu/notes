use android virtual device manager to switch devices, eclipse will install the app on the virtual device and run it
hardware options in avd
but some features are not available, performance/UX can be misleading

But can emulate
Network speed/latencies, battery power, location coordinates

------
telnet localhost {emulator port}
sample commands:
network speed edge
network speed full
power capacity 5
power status not-charging
geo fix 0.00 40.00

sms send {phone number} "{txt message}"

dial the second emulator number is the port
