CoreOS added operator to K8s
encapsulate domain ops into operator,and then inject Operator into K8s, operator calls native k8s API
Operater to k8s is like bash to OS

T-operator supports: create, rolling update, scale out, failover, backup/restore

K8s no local storage because to them network disk is common and normal, e.g., if service is down, start a new container, and attach volumn to the new pod

To elaborate: TiDB's patch to K8s => similar to DCOS's batch script

watch out for the case where index and shard data are not on the same shard : two cases where double scan won't be a problem! 

for backup needs, use mydumper to take backup periodically, and use loader to restore

can use chrony to support time sync => how to setup chrony??
