Links
------
Link to containers in another service. Either specify both the service name and a link alias (SERVICE:ALIAS), or just the service name.
Containers for the linked service will be reachable at a hostname identical to the alias, or the service name if no alias was specified.
Links are not required to enable services to communicate - by default, any service can reach any other service at that serviceâ€™s name.
