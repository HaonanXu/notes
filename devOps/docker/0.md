There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile. If you list more than one CMD then only the last CMD will take effect.

In fact, if you want your image to be runnable (without additional docker run command line arguments) you must specify an ENTRYPOINT or CMD.

we can override the default CMD by specifying an argument after the image name when starting the container

The default ENTRYPOINT can be similarly overridden but it requires the use of the --entrypoint

Combining ENTRYPOINT and CMD allows you to specify the default executable for your image while also providing default arguments to that executable which may be overridden by the user. Let's look at an example

When using ENTRYPOINT and CMD together it's important that you always use the exec form of both instructions. Trying to use the shell form, or mixing-and-matching the shell and exec forms will almost never give you the result you want.
