For stateful services like Kafka and Cassandra, use disk mount resources/local persistent volumes. Isolating demanding storeage services to dedicated storage agents, because FS page cache is host-level shared resource

For some stateful services such as Jenkins/Velocity, mount a shared netowrk drive to every node

-------
with LPV, tasks and their associated data are pinned to the node they are first launched on and will be relaunched on taht node if they terminate. The resoruces the application requires are also reserved

when you scale app down, the volumns associated with the terminated isntances are detached but all resources are still reserved

The container path from which yoru app will read and write data can not be nested or slashes
