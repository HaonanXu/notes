window the stream by time ususally needed for join and aggregation ops => can specifiy a retention period for the window, so to retain old

window buckets for a period of time in order to wait for the late arrival of records whose timestamps fall within the window interval

join over record streams usually nees to be performed on a windowing basis, because otherwise the # of records that must be maintained for
performaing the jon may grow too big

aggregation over record streams usually is on windowing basis => update an aggregate value upon late arrival of further records

windowing is required by aggregation over unbounded data

stream tasks determin the next assigned partiton to process among all its streams based on the ts of records => to enforce strice execution
ordering
=> either watiuntil system gets all the records form all streams
or to inject additonal information about ts boundary ro heuristice estimates
