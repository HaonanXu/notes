Cassandra => asumes clocks are synchronized, uses timestamps to revole conflicts between writes
alternative=> use vector clocks

Spanner: TrueTime: synch tiem but also estimates worst-case clock drift

partial order: anti-symmetry, transitivity, and reflexivity, but NOT totality
local clock order: partial order

time are used to determine if it high-latency or network link down: timeout
----
lamport lock: provides parital order
1.Whenever process does work, increase counter
2.whenever process sends a message, include the counter
3.when a message is recieved, set the counter to max(local, received) + 1

if counter(a) < count(b), either a happens before b, or a, b are not comparable

vector lock: maintains array of N logical clocks. each node increment its own clock by 1 for each internal event
similar to lamport clock, upon recieving a message, update local to max, AND THEN increase its own clock by 1 more
