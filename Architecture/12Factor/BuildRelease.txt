How is CB turned into deploy
1. build: code repo to exe bundle, a build, the build stage vendors
dependencies and compiles binaries/assents. Initialized when new code is
deployed.
2. release: takes the build and combine it with deploy's config
3. run: launch app processes against selected release. can happen
automatically,e.g., to restart the process. This stage needs to be simple so
if app fails to run, we can solve it without dev help

ability to rollback a release with deployment tools

Releases are append-only ledger and immutable. Have to create a new release
for changes
