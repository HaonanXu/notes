assign different types of work to a process type, e.g, web process, worker
process

never daemonize or write PID files. Rely on OS's process manager to manage
output, crashed processes, and user-initiated restarts and shutdowns

-----

we want app to be a managed process,i.e., run automatically when the operating
system stars up, and restarted if the proces crashes or dies for any reason=>
use the OS process manager

use of singleton process

no self-demonizing programs,or you will have to poll process list/pids

Discussion: 

actual use of upstart
