Use case -> implementation

What are the use cases of docker in deployment?
One common case is to isolate lib/code dependencies from the environment it runs on. Are there other cases?

How can we use docker in development process?
Common patterns?

----------------
implementation -> use case

the docker file and their commands
FROM => parent relationship?
RUN => bootstrap script goes here?
CMD => runs the app

How is dependency version managed?
RUN will probably just to apt-get install, but which version? Is there some nicer way to do package management such as pip's requirements.txt?

How does docker build the executable from code?
When we run docker given the docker file, what is the sequence of action,i.e., what does docker do to build and launch exe from code?
