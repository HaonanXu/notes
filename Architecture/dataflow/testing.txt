Unit testing pipeline locally, before performaing full runs with the service, is often the base of most direct way of identify and fix bugs

Unit testing DoFn before using them

use the test clases in the Dataflow SDKs to test an entire pipeline end-to-end
1. for every source of input data to your pipeline, create known static test input data
2. create some static test ouput data that matches what your expect in final output PCollection
3. Create a TestPipeline in place of the standard pipeline
