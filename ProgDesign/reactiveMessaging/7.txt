routing slip pattern: for series of fixed, linear processing steps, i.e., no conditional branching or looping. Otherwise, use full-blown
Process Manager

Two ways to implement a PM: DSL + interpreter, flow control rules coded directly into specialized PM

Example: gather loan quotes from many banks and return the best one
1. LoanBroker: PM, receives originating request
has startProcess/stopProcess methods, which persists processing actor and sends the messages to SELF

2. LoanRateQuote: used by PM to maintain state and process transition rule => One entity per Request.
3.CreditBureu
4. Bank acores
