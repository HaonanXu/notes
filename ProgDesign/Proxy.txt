Context
Often infeasible to access an object directly
Partitioning of objects ina system nay change as requirements evolve

Solution
Define a proxy that provides a surrogate thru which clients can access remote objects
Proxy and RemoteObject inherit from the same base class with methods defined
Clients calls a method on proxy to access Binder object. The proxy works together with Binder RPC to implemnet the Broker pattern

Dynamics
1. client calls method on Proxy
2. Proxy pre-processes,e.g., marshaling
3. Proxy calls method on Concrete object
4. Proxy post-processes,e.g., unmarshalling, and returns to client


-may impose overly restrictive type system
-not possible to entirely shield clients from problms with IPC
