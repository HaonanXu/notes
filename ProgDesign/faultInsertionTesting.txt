code injection:
changing a predetermined portion of the source code to produce semantically incorrect mutatnt
applying a ptach to the object code at a designated location

state injection: system-level fault "manifestation" is injected as an errorneous state intended to minic the error produced by a fault,e.g., by debugger, message, storage, or command

Faults are inserted in the service manager to trigger the reaction in the fault manager

detection, isolation, recovery, and reporting are rarely implemented in one centralized location phsically. They are often distributed in separate software components and cooperate and coomunicate using a fault tolerance protocol
