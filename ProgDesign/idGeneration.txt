How do people generate ids for records, so they can identify, locate, and potentially retrieve data quickly?
1.Trivial case: id themselves has no relationship with data
auto incremental number, global GUID store...
implementation would be interesting

2.more interesting case: id is somewhat related to data
git's revision hash: why designed that way?
1. hard to assign serial # as revision in distributed system,i.e., a hybrid approach, where local uses revision number, across uses hashes
2. 
The source tree of the commit (which unravels to all the subtrees and blobs)
The parent commit sha1
The author info
The committer info (right, those are different!)
The commit message

Any other cases?
