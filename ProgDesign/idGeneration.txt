How do people generate ids for records, so they can identify, locate, and potentially retrieve data quickly?
1.Trivial case: id themselves has no relationship with data
auto incremental number, global GUID store...
implementation would be interesting

2.more interesting case: id is somewhat related to data
git's revision number: why designed that way?

Any other cases?
