objective: 
In a single sentence, qualitative goal
Should be inspirational, not conform to status quo or describe business as usual
the goal should be time bound, but not too long
Try setting only one


key results: 
most often three,  
quantitative metrics to meature if objective has been reached by the end of the period
difficult but not impossible, i.e., 50% of failing, as if it is truly random
something happened because of something you did
can be time-related if not by default end of the whole period
You always get what you measure, so focus on the right incentives
Don't give different weights to KRs even though they contribute different level of values=> it is about tendency, not perfection



much of the value in OKRs comes from the conversation on what matters
baking OKR into weekly meetings and weekly status mail
DO NOT CHANCE OKR, let it fail and set better goal next time
staring with one OKR per 
If you can't keep on track longer than a week. Then you are not ready for OKR yet. This is especailly true for startups
OKR should be reviewed weekly or biweekly to ensure focus.
