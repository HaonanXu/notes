tech vs customer/analyst/domain expoert communication: either side dominates => project loses

Story: 1. description for planning and reminder, functionality valued by USER
  2. conversations about the story as details
  3. tests that can be used to determin when a story is complete
  4. needs to be done by CUSTOMER, and NOT in tech jargons

When a story is too large it becomes epics

But we do not break down story into every last detail. Talk with customer about details when details become important. 

But story is not contract, test is!

customer team: tests, PM, real users (as comprehensive as possible), interaction designers
They are visioneris, and write story in a story writing workshop 

velocity: how much work a developer can do in an iteration

customer team can make corrections before the start of each iteration

--------
1.1
Description
Conversations
Test

1.2

1.3
a. yes, since it directly affects user experience 

b. No, no impact on user, but may have impact on purchaser

c. yes, that level of detail is alright(!)

d. No, this is a contract

e. maybe, same as b

f. too small

g. no end user impact

h. too small, detail of that level is fine(!)

i. too small

j. good

1.4.(!) Written documents imply a precision that they canâ€™t back. User stories, with cards as reminders to hold conversations, avoid the false appearance of being highly precise.

1.5. Writing tests on the back of a card is a great way for the customer to communicate her expectations and assumptions about a story.
