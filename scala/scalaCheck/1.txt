use of arbitaray with implicit to generate custom type implicitly

------
Symmetry: inversible operation

Multiple paths:
each represents one side of the properies, in many statement perhaps

Induction: you supply the the additional case data

Invariants: 
after bunch of ops, what should remain constant?
identity ops

idempotence: ops many times = op as one

consistency

often patterns are combined

handling error, within or out of design space?

Type driven development
