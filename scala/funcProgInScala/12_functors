Appliacative functor: map2 and unit are primitive

because map can be implemented by map2, applicative itself is a functor
because map2 can be implemented by flatmap, all monads are applicative functors

th Applicative, the structure of our computation is fixed; with Monad, the results of previous computations may influence what computations
to run next.
