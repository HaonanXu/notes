a key technique for dealing with external effects—using pure functions to compute a description of an effectful computation, which is then
executed by a separate interpreter that actually performs those effects.

It is always possible to factor an impure procedure into a pure “core” function and two procedures with side effects: one that supplies the
pure function’s input and one that does something with the pure function’s output. 

Note how the side effect, println, is now only in the outermost layer of the program, and what’s inside the call to println is a pure
expression.

 inside every function with side effects is a pure function waiting to get out.
