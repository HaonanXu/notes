When actor stops, its children stop in an undefined order, what if you need to encure a particluar shutdown order so that postStop() methods
get called in the right order

Idea: remove workers from master and put them under a terminator, which uses master as a hook to trigger business logic

problem: when master restarts, Chilren response from terminator wont get there until all of the pre-exisitng requests have been flushed
through the master

Options:
1.ignore
2.stash ehse away until ready to deal with them
3.tell client to come back later
4.Await.result(surrogate ? GetChilredn(self), 5. seconds) and store the chilrend in a var

PriorityMailbox may introduce race condition
