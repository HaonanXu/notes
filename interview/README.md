### Why notes on interview ###

```
1. Everyone hates it, but it is part of the job. Therefore, knowing the rules of the game makes one better interviewer and interviewee. 

2. Knowing "protocols" of interviews will make communiciation between both sides more efficient, i.e., shows respect to everyone's time

3. The proper interview style of communication should be highly efficient. This is a great way to evaluate candidate's communication skill in a professional settings. This also means , ideally, our professional communication should follow the similar pattern. 

5. Knowing rules of the game doesn't mean you can cheat. In fact, human beings are really good at detecting fake emotions, unless you are a great actor. The overall goal is to present yourself in an efficent way. Conversely, an interviewer needs to  understand what tricks the candidate might pull off.
