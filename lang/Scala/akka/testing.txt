TestActorRef: 
obtaining a reference to the underlying actor instance
invoking or querying the actor's behavior

recommended: use behavioural testing instead of actorRef whenever possible, i.e., using messagin th ask the Actor to reply with the state you want to run assertions against

TestActorRef is synchronous, so it will not work with support traits that rquires async behaviours

TAR supports all operations valid on normal ActorRef. Messages sent to the actor are processed synchronously on the current thread and answers may be sent back as usual

common use case: setup the actor into a specific internal state before sending the test message
another is to verify correct internal state transitions after ahving sent the test message

--------
Verifying expected exceptions can not be done direclty: replace normal event handler with TestEventListener

-----
use of TestProbe to expect message
