resources folder in main/test: files to include in jar

Directory other than main and test in src will be ignored

project/ folder of the base directory can contain .scala files, which are combined with .sbt files to form the complete build definition

by default, generated files go to target folder. which means .gitignore should have "target/"

top level objects and classes are not allowed in build.sbt. They should go in project/ as full scala source files

package is a TaskKey[File] and its value is the jar file it creates

can drop jars in lib/ for unmanaged dependencies

++= Seq(..) to append another seq 

If your project is in directory hello, and you’re adding sbt-site plugin to the build definition, create hello/project/site.sbt 

addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-site" % "0.7.0")

If you’re adding sbt-assembly, create hello/project/assembly.sbt
addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-assembly" % "0.11.2")
