Appliacative functor: map2 and unit are primitive

def map2[A,B,C] (fa:F[A], fb: F[B])(f:(A,B) =>C) : F[C]

because map can be implemented by map2, applicative itself is a functor

another primitive can be apply instead of map2, hence the name, and monad is applicative functor as well

th Applicative, the structure of our computation is fixed; with Monad, the results of previous computations may influence what computations
to run next.
