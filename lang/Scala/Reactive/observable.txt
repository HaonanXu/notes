1. Future and Try are duals
Future trait onComplete is of type
(Try[T] => Unit) => Unit
reverse the direction, we get
() =>(() =>Try[T])

i.e., when this executes many times, we get Try[T]

2. Iterable and observable are duals
Iterator can be simplified to type
() => Option[T]

Iterable, therefore, can be simplifed to () =>(() => Try[Option[T]])
