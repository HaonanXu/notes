3 things during app bootstrap

use of angular-seed

Bootstrap via bower

test controller with custom scope

normally Jasmine for BDD

angular-seed is pre-configured using Karma

end-to-end test to test DOM

can create our own services, system services are prefixed with $, just as  $scope, $http

catch. minification and DI

event handling with ng-client, #scope.setImage= funciton(imageUrl) { //modify $scope state here}

use ngResource to avoid low level detail with default $http service
