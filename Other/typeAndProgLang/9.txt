Since pure l-calculus is turing complete, can not given exact type analysis, e.g., have to run some tricky computation to determin the type
returned in a if, but the computation may diverage

Give every l-abstraciton the type T(1) -> T(2)

The set of simple types over Bool is T : = Bool | T -> T

-> is right associative, i.e., T(1) -> T(2) -> T(3) = T(1) -> (T(2) -> T(3))

explicitly typed: type annotations in terms tohelp guide the typechecker

Because terms may contain nested l-abstraction, typing relation becomes 3 place => need assumption of the types of the free varaibles in t
on top of t: T: gamma |- t: T

typing context/environment gamma is a sequence of variables and their types. 

T-ABS: Gamma, x: T(1) |- t2 t2: T(2) => gamma |- l(x):T(1).t2 : T(1)-> T(2)

T-VAR: x: T in gamma => gamma |- x: T

T-APP: 
1. gamma |- t(1) : T(11) -> T(12)  
2. gamma |- t(2): T(11)

1 + 2 => gamma |- t1 t2 : T(12)
