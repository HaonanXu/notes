arithmetic syntax: either eval to a value or stuck at some stage, which means meaningless or erroneous programs

a term t has type T: we can reason STATICALLY that t evals to a val of appropriate form

example typing rules: the typing relation is the smallest binary relation between terms and types satisfyng all isntances of the rules. t is
typable/well-typed if there is some T s.t. t: T

inversion of the typing relation
