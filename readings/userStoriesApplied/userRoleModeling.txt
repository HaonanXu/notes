identify user roels and personas before writing stories

need reasonable representation of the devs and customers in the init BS session, where each one comes up with new roles as much as you can,
and categorize them => at least cover MVP case

also need to rip unimportant role cards for roles that are unimportant to the success of the system

minimal metrics for user:
1. use frequency
2. expertise with the domain
3. level of proficiency with the software being developed
4. general goal for using the software

persona: make sure enough market and demo research done

extreme character: unlikely users for the systems, to lead to stories that you may miss
