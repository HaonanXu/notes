windowing primitives
1. assign datum to windows

How is groupByKeyAndWindow implemented?

------
example: log joining pipelines in MillWheel. Customer stops trusting weak consistency model
session is one of the the core use cases

billing pipeline had problem with watermarks

aggregate stats: no need to be 100%, but need to process majority of data quickly

anomaly detection: data-driven trigger, composition trigger
