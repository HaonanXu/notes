PMs talk to users to help figure out what to build, define requirements, and write functional specs=> a sounding board for ideas, help balance the schedule when technical challenges occur. 

PMs are invloved from before the first code is written, until after it goes out the door

The PMs are part of the engineering team. Good product managers are the marketing counterparts of the engineering manager. 

In software it is not just about executing the advertising strategy. Because the products change so quickly, it is also about deciding what to build, and executing that

3 major areas for product manager
1.UI/UX
Not necessarily what makes money but what makes a better produt
2.Tech
understanding implementation, managing the schedule and checking in on accomplishments. A more technical pm might work directly with engineering team to create an API spec
3.Strategy/Business
Similar to brand management in other industries. Which business areas the product needs to grow in and why. It also means running A/B tests and other experiments to help optimize the performance and revenue of the product 

engineering leads can set clear expectations of what they need from PMs. This will help PM prioritize their own work and create a more solid relationship the engineering team. 

Engieering lead and PM can absorb their shared responsibilities, including keeping track of schedules, breakdowns, and progress

senior engieers have built many products and worked with many product managers and should not be afraid to give feedback to new PMs

Engieers can offer new pm with technical education

observing a design critique is a good way to see how designers view their work.
