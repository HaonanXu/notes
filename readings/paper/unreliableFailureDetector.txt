solves async consensus with crash failures
consensus can be solved with UFD with infinite # of mistakes, some can solve despite any # of crashes, some requires majority
consensus and atomic broadcast can be reduced to each other in async system with crash failures

because we can not decide if a process has crashed or "very slow", we can not deterministically solve consense in an async system with even
a single crash failure

completeness and accuracy: eventually suspects all failed processes + restricts mistake a FD can make
