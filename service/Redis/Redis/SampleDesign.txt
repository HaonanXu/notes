to generate uid: keep a UID field, and use incr to generate new one
To get user id => a hash users stores name => id

store user detail: a hash keyed User:{id}

user has followers and following and posts to read, so keys
followers:{userid}
following:{userid}
posts:{user id}

similarly, because we want to see indiviual post, we need
post:{post id}
and this means we posts:{user id} stores only post id

we can keep a list keyed "timeline" to keep track of most recent posts

pagination: just lrange on "posts:{id}"
