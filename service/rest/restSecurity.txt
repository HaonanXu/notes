From OWASP

Should use session-based authentication, either by a session token via a POST or by using API key as a POST body argument or as a cookie

Use only the session token or API key to maintain client state in a server-side cache

Defend against replay attack, espeically you have state blob send as part of transcation: use time limited encryption key, keyed against the sseion token or API key, date and time, and incoming IP address.

No techinical method of preventing being farmed against

Make sure the incoming HTTP method is valid for the session token/API key and association resource, action, and record,e.g., everyone can view, but probably not everyone can delete

Always check Content-Type header. An empty or unexpected one should give 406 Not Acceptable

Always send the Content-Type header with the correct Content-Type, and preferrably include a char set

When inserting values into the browser DOM, use .value/.innerText/.textContent rather than .innerHTML
