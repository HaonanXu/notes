1. register the app with service, including redirect URI

2. any http redirect URI must be protected with TLS

3. gets client ID and client serecret, use client ID to build login URLs, or include in the Js source code

-------
1. For log in link: 

https://oauth2server.com/auth?response_type=code&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&scope=photos

2. and then it will redirect back to the site

https://oauth2client.com/cb?code=AUTH_CODE_HERE

3. server exchanges the auth code for an access token

POST https://api.oauth2server.com/token
    grant_type=authorization_code&
    code=AUTH_CODE_HERE&
    redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&
    client_id=CLIENT_ID&
    client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET

4. Now what with access token, make requests to the API, make sure it is on HTTPS and never ignore invalid certificates
