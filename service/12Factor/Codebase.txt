1-to-1 correspondence between CB and app. That means:

1.
1 app to multiple code base means a distributed system, with each CB mapping
to a (maybe silightly) different app
2.
part of the same code base used by multiple apps: refactor the shared code
into libs and included via dependency manager
3. 
One CB per app
4.
Same codebase, maybe at different verions, across all deploys,i.e., dev,
qa, staging, prod

------
Discussion

1.
No code sharing across repositories. If app A depends on (partly or fully) on
app B. the common part needs to be factored out, and app A should not
include/refer app B's code directly in A's CB

2.
Concretely, code should not branch based on deployment

Conceptually, from an interpreter perspective, CB provides the lexical
scope,i.e., function definition, and deploy(= CB + environment) provides runtime environment,
i.e.,arguments to the function. Code difference between deploys would means
loss of lexcial scoping
