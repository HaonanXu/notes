PD role:
global id generation
global timestamp generation
tikv metadata
routing client

All PD state is gathered passively by the heatbeat from TiKV. the coordination command are piggybacked on heatbeat messages to TiKV servers

PD leader is different from the etcd leader!

PD provide a timestamp oracle for increasing (not necessarily continous) timestampes

physical time + logical time
1. when PD becomes leader, will get last saved time from etcd, and hold until current time >= that value
2. apply a lease to etcd, within this window PD will be the TSO
3. client batchs n request and get TSs togehter from PD

------
To split region
1. Leader peer sends request to PD
2. PD creates new region ID and peer ID, and return to leader peer
3. leader peer writes the split action into a raft log, and execute it at apply
4. Tikv tells PD, PD updates cache and persist it to etcd
