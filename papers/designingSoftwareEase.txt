chains of commands: hard to remove a component because output of its predecessor is not compatible with the input requirement of successor

More powerful mechanism could have been build separately from, simpler mecahnism

nothing works until everything works => suggests not a DAG in its dependency

For better structure:
1. try to location MVP
2. even the presence or absense of a component should be hidden from other components
3. but independent parts will lead to duplication of code

Use sandwiching to resolve dependency on each other

no correspondency between modules and levels: one module may have many levels, one level may be divided across modules
