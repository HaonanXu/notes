Certain "cross-domain" requests, notably Ajax requests, however are forbidden by default by the same-origin security policy.

An origin is defined as a combination of URI scheme, hostname, and port number. 

--------
When performing certain types of cross-domain Ajax requests, modern browsers that support CORS will insert an extra "preflight" request to determine whether they have permission to perform the action.

OPTIONS /
Host: service.example.com
Origin: http://www.example.com

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT, DELETE
