Pay and order good, but point service failed - should find a way to recover the points, instead of rollback payment and order

X/Open DTP:  2PC implementation
---------
Prepare: each rm do everything but commit

1. prepare phase locked down multiple DBs across services already

2. very hard to scale

3. requires compoments to support XA protocol, but this turns out to be hard to achieve

MQ based solution,
---------
need reliable MQ broker at sender and receiver end

to recover msg to be acked over long time, need to talk to upstream service to either update the state of the message to sent, or delete the message

In practive, need human intervetion capabilities, and limit max retries, and publish it to the deadletter queue

need a delay based queue, at the serivce entrance, start, at the end of execution flow, cancel it, if execution is not done, the delay job will go trough the process


TCC
--------
1. main service calls try on all sub services, and log all in the activity monitor

2. note that we need to handle confirm failure case, i.e., rollback all confirms, and cancel

3. if all tries are good, the main service executes local tranx, send confirm/cancel to AM, AM will cofirm on sub services, if they are good, AM tells main service to submit. Otherwise, AM will use the cancel endpoints on the subservices 

4. if any of the sub services talied to try, the main service will rollback and over. The successful tries will use a batch job to cancel good tried that timed out - roll back them

5. no need to execute service 2's commit immediately, can do it asynchly

Can combine TCC with MQ based solution
1. try: persist message

2. confirm: send message

3. cancel: delete message

Do-compensate TCC
