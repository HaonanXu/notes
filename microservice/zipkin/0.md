inbound and outbound requests are in different spans
spans that include cs can log an sa annotation of where they are going
This helps when the destination protocol isn’t Zipkin instrumented, such as MySQL.


zipkin-server is a Spring Boot application, packaged as an executable jar. You need JRE 8+ to start zipkin-server.
Span storage and collectors are configurable. By default, storage is in-memory

/ - UI
/config.json - Configuration for the UI
/api/v2 - Api
/health - Returns 200 status if OK
/info - Provides the version of the running instance
/metrics - Includes collector metrics broken down by transport type

Zipkin even supports a Spring Boot-based implementation of this REST API. Using that is as simple as using Zipkin’s @EnableZipkinServer directly. The Zipkin Server delegates writes to the persistence tier via a SpanStore. Presently, there is support for using MySQL or an in-memory SpanStore out-of-the-box.
