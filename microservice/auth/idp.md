Relying party applications, such as web applications, outsource the user authentication step to a trusted identity provider. Such a relying party application is said to be federated, that is, it consumes federated identity.

(A federated identity in information technology is the means of linking a person's electronic identity and attributes, stored across multiple distinct identity management systems)

An identity provider is “a trusted provider that lets you use single sign-on (SSO) to access other websites.”

In the domain model associated with OIDC, an identity provider is a special type of OAuth 2.0 authorization server.
