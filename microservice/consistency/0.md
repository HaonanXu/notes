Pay and order good, but point service failed - should find a way to recover the points, instead of rollback payment and order

X/Open DTP:  2PC implementation
---------
Prepare: each rm do everything but commit

1. prepare phase locked down multiple DBs across services already

2. very hard to scale

3. requires compoments to support XA protocol, but this turns out to be hard to achieve

MQ based solution,
---------
need reliable MQ broker at sender and receiver end

to recover msg to be acked over long time, need to talk to upstream service to either update the state of the message to sent, or delete the message

In practive, need human intervetion capabilities, and limit max retries, and publish it to the deadletter queue

need a delay based queue, at the serivce entrance, start, at the end of execution flow, cancel it, if execution is not done, the delay job will go trough the process
