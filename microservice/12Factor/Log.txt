typically one event per line

app never concerns itself with routing or storage of outpust stream. each process just writes unbuffered to stdout

In staging/prod, each process's stream is caputured by the execution environtment and routed to archival destinations.

The destination is not visible or configurable by the app => e.g. we use log router such as logplex/fluent

Introsepcting app's behavior over time via log,e.g.,
finding specific events
graphing of trends
active alerting according to heuristics

---------
One-off admin processes should be run in an identiacl environment as the regular processes against a release, same codebase and config. admin code must be shipped with application code

In local deploy, developers invoke one-off admin processes by direct shell command inside the app's checkout dir.
In production depoy, ssh into the shell to do similar thing
