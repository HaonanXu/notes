apps are disposable,i.e., fast to start/shutdown so we can have fast
deplouyment, scaling.

graceful shutdown by SIGTERM:
1. cease to listen on service port
2. finish current request and then exit
3. client should seamlessly reconnect when connection is lsot
4. worker should return its current job back to queue. meaning the job is
reentrant,i.e., either operation's execution/writing is an all or nothing
transaction, or it is idempotent
