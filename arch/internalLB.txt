only private IP address The DNS name of an internal load balancer is publicly resolvable to the private IP addresses of the nodes. Therefore, internal load balancers can only route requests from clients with access to the VPC for the load balancer

 Create an Internet-facing load balancer and register the web servers with it. Create an internal load balancer and register the database servers with it. The web servers receive requests from the Internet-facing load balancer and send requests for the database servers to the internal load balancer. The database servers receive requests from the internal load balancer.

 Each load balancer node is connected to the private IP addresses of the back-end instances using elastic network interfaces. If cross-zone load balancing is enabled, each node is connected to each back-end instance, regardless of Availability Zone. Otherwise, each node is connected only to the instances that are in its Availability Zone.
