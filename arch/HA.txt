generally use leader/follower pattern

Fault domain isolation: systems must be distributed across fault domains, Masters across racks , but maybe not DCs or regions

Agents may be distributed across regions/DCs (and tag them with region info as well)

Sync service such as ZK shoudl reamin within the same region/DC (really?)

Running multiple ZK clusters for separate services

services should expose health check endpoints, which can be used by services like marathon

avoid storing client state on the server between requests
