Taking into consideration all the risks and factors, we believe that the physical segmentation of private data is currently the only viable way to achieve this requirement. Some solutions have sought to solve this issue with the use of encryption, but from our experience with regulations governing data sharing and persistence, analysis of revealed data to uncover patterns, and forward secrecy (meaning that if there is a compromise later, it does not compromise the full history), we do not believe this is yet a viable solution for this industry.

blockchain as a privacy-preserving uniqueness service with a built-in notification mechanism. 

The GSL is a log of commitments and notification sets that guarantees the integrity of the distributed data stores and the auditability of the stakeholders to the contracts in the Distributed Ledger 

a network-wide blockchain carries fingerprints of sensitive data. The actual data is segregated and communicated over private channels only to eligible parties

Segregated Ledgers and Data and Execution Commitments. These  are similar in concept, in both the components responsible for producing evidence of the validity of a transaction are separated from the transaction data itself.
