Pig for ETL, where unstructured data is reformatted so that it is easier to define a structure to it
Hive when query data that has a certain known structure to it

Hive queries are not meant to execute in real time

The data in Hive is read only. New partitions can be inserted, but not individual rows

The files for a Hive table can be stored in a folder anywhere in HDFS by LOCATION clause
