NameNode federation

The ResourceManager allocates resources for applications but does not manage the lifecycle of applications. Instead, applications are
managed by an ApplicationMaster that runs on a node in the cluster. Each application running in the cluster requires its own
ApplicationMaster.

 That node’s NodeManager (NM) creates an instance of the ApplicationMaster (AM)
• The AM then sends a request to the RM, asking for specific resources, like memory and CPU requirements. The RM replies with a list of
Containers, which includes the specific DataNodes to start the Containers
• The AM starts a Container on each DataNode as instructed by the RM. The Container performs a task, as directed by the AM
As the tasks are being performed by the Containers, the client application can request status updates directly from the ApplicationMaster.
