known cases:
task instance failure, 
container(s) failure
yarn job failure, 
node failure
network failure

expected behavior:
task instance faillure: need knowledge from samza => probably will trigger container failure?

container failure: who will restart it? samza or yarn => can force failure at code level

yarn job failure: yarn knowledge. AM coordinates execution of all task within the application. will restart failed tasks

node failure: common scenario, must be tool somewhere

network failure: should test, but less likely to happen

yarn/samza am should handle the failed task instance and restart

so to test:
1. forced failure of task instance
2. forced failure of a node

if your AM failed, there is nothing you can do
