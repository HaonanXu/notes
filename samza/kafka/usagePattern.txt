1.how many topics to have? how many partions each topic or in total?
i.e., how to choose # of topic partitions

less than 10k topics, because each topic has a ZooKeepr znode
moreover 100k partitions on a single topic is same as 100k topics with one parttion each

ZK is a non-shared in-memory database that stores per-partition configuraiton information
 it’s probably better to limit the number of partitions per broker to two to four thousand and the total number of partitions in the cluster to low tens of thousand.

# of parititons should scale only with the number of consuming machines not with any charactieristics of the data. e.g. single topic and partioin it by user_id

2.how to add paritions to topic?
script avaialbe

3.how to rebalance paritions within a same topic?
script available but with caches

4.What if the message is big?
big message doesnt fit message queue system, probably should pass a handle instead

5.can store the data persistantly to do peridocially recalc

6.Limitation of the message size
