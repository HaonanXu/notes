1. What to install?
-------------
Use Dockerfile to set up dev samsa environment

2.  How To make a samsa job?
-------------
You need to make: 
* a samza package, which is a tarball 
* a samza job configuration file.

3. What is a samza package?
------------------
Just a tarball with the following structure (unzipped)

* bin/run-am.sh
* bin/run-class.sh
* bin/run-job.sh
* bin/run-container.sh
* lib/

The .sh files are from dependency 
* groupID: org.apahce.samza 
* artifactID: samza-shell
* classifier: dist
* type: tgz

4. What is in the JARs?
-----------------
The class represents your job processing logic. All your stream processing logic should be in a class that implement org.apache.samza.task.StreamTask interface, and more specifically, its process() method
Note that all jars from samza will be in lib as well. This is part of their design decision to isolate dependency

5. How to implement process() method?
-----------------
* read incoming messages from envelope
* use collector to send output message wrapped in OutgoingMessageEnveloope, whose format is just dual of incoming envelope's
NOTE: do NOT use collector outside process()
* coordinator for advanced use

6.How to make configuration file?
------------
see the sample configuration .properties file for detailed explaination, at minimum, you need to define:
* job.factory.class
* job.name
* task.class
* task.inputs

7. How to build and deploy package?
-------------
* Create a configuration .properties file for your new task class
* sudo mvn package
* put the generated tarball to a location the worker process/box can access. When developing locally, a file path is generally enough.

8. How to run the package?
-------------
$PACKAGE_PATH/bin/run-job.sh --config-factory=samza.config.factories.PropertiesConfigFactory --config-path=$CONFIG_FILE_PATH

9. How to know if my job is running correctly?
------------
* YARN's web UI lists running, waiting, killed jobs. web UI port default is 8088
* check the $YARN_BIN_PATH/logs/usrlog.
