when looking for the minimal viable value

	ll l = 0, r = INF;
	while(r - l > 1)
	{
		ll x = (l + r) / 2;
		if (solve(x) >= m)
			r = x;
		else
			l = x;
	}

Then check if r is good value

Since bsearch is kind of search, a lot of search insight applies here, e.g., when it is hard to find an insight, we can use bsearch to
introduce a variable and run simulation process. Of course the condition is that there must be a clear line separating good and bad regions
, i.e., they can not mix. Often is the trick is at how to contruction such a condition on a related subproblem
