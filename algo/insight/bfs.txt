can be used for shortest path of all edges are unit length

-------

pseudo code

q = {root}

while(!q.isempty){
  head = q.pop

  if(visited[head])
    continue;
  else
    visited[head] = true

  foreach neighbor of head //replace it with your generation logic
    q.push(neighbor);
}

Normally dfs and bfs does not return result, instead, states are mutated via state vraiables
