can be used for shortest path of all edges are unit length

-------
pseudo code, version 1

curDist
//populate all seeds

LP(dist, 0, max)
{
	nextDist
	for each seed in curDist
	{
		if seed is target
			return dist
		
		Try expand seed //mark visited inside
		insert expanded into nextDist
	}

	replace curDist with nextDist
}

-------

pseudo code version 2, this version is espeically useful if graph has no cycles

q = {root}

while(!q.isempty){
  head = q.pop

  if(visited[head])
    continue;
  else
    visited[head] = true

  foreach neighbor of head //replace it with your generation logic
    q.push(neighbor);
}

Normally dfs and its variants does not return result, instead, states are mutated via state vraiables
