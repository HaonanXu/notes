log: quickly compute large power or hard to compute power, especially if we dont need precise number.
Another use of that is dealing with small double multipllications, this can avoid a lot of underflow problems, espeically important in probability calculations

base number is about representation. It doesnt affect the arithmetic properties

when assertion, if something, organize code so that variables involved in that statement is immediately changed ->  to avoid double-counting and infinite loop

the sliding window generally works when everything is triggered by
moving your end pointer, and front pointer merely follows. If moving the head pointer also has to trigger calculating some other state, the
sliding window often is not applicable
