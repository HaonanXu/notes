curIndex - length you want to skip = start index of that subarray you want to skip

starting index + length = starting index of the new subarray

mid point index of array = length/2

Array length - starting index = length of the subarray starting at the index

Coversely, Array length - subarray length = start index of the subarray of that length and ends at tail

index2 - index1 = length of subarray from index1 + 1 to index2
