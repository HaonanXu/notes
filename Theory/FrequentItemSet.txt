Support for itemset I = # of baskets containing all items in I
support threshold s: sets of itmes that appear in at least s baskets: frequent itemsets

Example:
Basket= sentences, items=documents containing those sneences
items do not have to be "in" baskets, i.e., just need many to many relationship

Baskets=documents; items=words

Assocuation rules: {i1,i2,...ik}-> j
Confidence of association rule

Algorithm:
Find all sets with support at least cs
Find all sets with suport at least s
from cs, remove one element, see which subsets have support at lease s.
How to compute confidence in this algo?

Computation model:
data kept basket-by-bastket on flat file

=> hardest problem is finding the frequent pairs. Support thresold is et high enought that you dont get too many frequesnt itemsets
-------
monotonicity: if a set of items appears at least s times, so does eveyr subset of S
Conversely, if item i does not appear in s, then no pair including i can appear in s

A-Priorit:
Read baskets and count in main memory the occurence of each time
Items that appear at least s times are the frequent items
Read bakets again and count in main memory only those pairs both of which were found in pas 1 to be frequent

Can use the triangular matrix method with n = # of frequestn items

So use more passes to extend to k-sets from 2
C1 -> filter -> L1 -> construct->c2 -> filter -> L2
---------
Improvement:
in pass 1, keep counts of buckets into which pairs of items are hashed
for each basket, enumerate all its pairs, hash them, and increment the resulting bucket count by 1

a bucket is frequent if its count is at least the support threshold
