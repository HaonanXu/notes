Formal Model:
C= set of Customers
S=set of Items
Utility funciton U:C *S -> R(atings)
problem: U is sparse. Cold start problem
------
content-based recoomendation: recommend items to x similar to previous items rated highly by x
for each item, create an item profile
Profile=set of "important" words in item
TF-IDF => doc profile: set of words with hightest TF-IFD scores

distance in higher dimension space, User profile x, item profile i
Estimate U(x, i) = (x dp i)/ (|x||i|)

No need for data on other users
able to recommend to users with unique tastes
no first-rater problem
explanations for recommended items

finding the appropriate features is hard
overspecialization

-----------
Collaborative: centered cosine nromalized ratings by substracing row mean
Handles tough raters and easy raters

how about item-item collaborative filtering

-------
How to find k most similar users? NN/LSH in high dimenstions, clustering, dimensionality reduction

No feature selection needed, but has cold start,sparsity, first rater, popularity bias problem
So use hybrid methods: item profiles for new item problem, demographics to deal with new user problems
or use two or more different recommenders and combine results
------
Evaluate recommender system: compare predictions agains withheld known ratings 
=> RMSE but it has problems => precision at top k
