Online algo: bipartite matching:
offline: hopcroft-Karp

Greedy algo and competitive ratio analysis => worst case example

------
AdWord problem

simple algo: sort on expected value
but CTR of an ad is unknown, and advertisers ahve lim,ited budges and bid on multipe ads

--------
Simplified environment:
1 ad shown for each query
all advertisers have the same budge
all ads are equally likely to be clicked
value of each ad is the same

simplest algo: => competitive ratio?

balance algo: for each queyr, pick the advertiser with larget unspent dubge, break ties arbitarrily but in a deterministic way
=> competitive ratio?
