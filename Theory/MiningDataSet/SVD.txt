SVD
A[m * n] = U [m * r] Sig[r*r](V[n*r])^T
r: rank of the matrix A. 

U: left singular vectors, r concepts, user to concept
Sig, singular values: concept strength

V:right singluar vectors: movie-to-concept

Always possible to decompose A where U, Sig, V, unique, U, V, coulmn orthonormal, Sig: diagonal
----------
SVD: best axis to project on: min sum of squares of projection erros =? minimum reconstruction error

use movie-to-concert to find axis => Sig gives spread on the axis

U*Sig = coordinates of proints in the axis

How to do dr: set smallest singular values to zero

how to mark similarily of matrices

-----

SVD: best low rank approx.

U = sig1 * U1 * V1^T + sig2 * U2 ....
Ui and Vi are unti length, sigi scales them

How many sigs to keep => preserve Ssig(i)^2

--------
map query into a concep space?
q(concept) = q * V

relation to eigen-decomposition:

singular vectors are dense
