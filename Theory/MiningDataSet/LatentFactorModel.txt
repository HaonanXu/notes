Utility Matrix R and its RMSE

Mult-scale modleing of the data:
Global: overall deivation of users/movies
Facotrization: regional effects
Collborative filter: local patterns

Global: mean rating + movie diff with averate + user's avg diff
Local nieghborhodd (Collaborative filtering/NN) => final estimate

CF: derive unknown ratings from those of "similar" movies (item-item)
similarity(ij) => select k-nearest neighbors, compute the rating, 
N(i;x) = items most ismilar to i that were rated by x

rxi = sij * rxj over N(i, x) /  sij over N(i, x)

to include global effect

rxi = bxi +..sij(rxj - bxj)..

bxi = beta/overal mean rating + avg biase for x + avg biase for i

problem: similarity measures arbitary
pairwise similarities neglect dependences among users
a weighted average can be restricting

----------

buld a system s.t. it works well on known (user, item) ratings, and hope the system wil also predict well the unknown ratings

"SVD" on R = Q * P^T
R: item to users, Q: items to factors, P: users to factors

R has missing entries but ignore for now

How to estimate the missing rating of user x for item i?

SVD gives min reconstruction error SSE => SVD is minimizing RMSE
but, SVD error is over all entries, but R has missing entries.
=> used specialized methods to find P, Q
min sum of (rxi - qi * pxT)^2 over all (i,x) in R

P,Q dont require to be orthogonal/unit length. 
P,Q map users/moves to a latent space
----------

Want large k to capture all the signals => but SSE on test data begins to rise for k>2==> overefitting: fits too well the training dtat and thus not generailzing well to unseen test data

introduce relaization: allow rich model where there are sufficient data, shrink aggresively hwere data are scarce

add a "length" part lambda (||Px||^2 + ||qi||^2)

min multi-dimension optimization? => gradient descent, init P and Q with SVD, pretitng missing ratings as 0
