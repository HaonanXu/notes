Euclidean space: there is a notion of "average" of two points
distance measure function axiom
>= 0. =0 if x =y, d(x.y) = d(y,x), d(x,y) <= d(x,z) + d(z.y)

proof of JD is distance measure => convert to minhash to prove: whenever mh(x) !+ mh(y), at least one of thw two statements are ture

consine is p1 *p2/|p1|*|p2|

--------
Supervised learning: data is labeled: have many pairs {(x,y)}. do prediction:estimate f(x) s.t. y=f(x)

Instance based learning: nearest neighbor: a query example q comes, find closes examples x*, perdict y*

Collaborative filterting: k-NN classifier. Find k most similar people that rated movie y, perdict new y for the new user

To make NN work:
1. distance metric
2. how many neighbors to look at
3.weighting function
4. how to fit with the local points

useLSH to find NN
