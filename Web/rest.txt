/video => all videos
	GET: list of all vidoe
	PUT: create/replace the whole collection
	POST: create a new video and add it to the video list, the newly created resource will be returned
/video/1 => specific one video
	PUT: create/replace the one video
/video/1/duration => a part of a video


So PUT/DELETE are ideompotent,while POST is not

versioning API
version in URL or custom accept header

----
Authentication: 
1. http basics over SSL, in header
Authorization: Basic {username: password in base 64}

2.HMAC, in header
Authentication: hmac username:nonce:{salted hash of secret}
Date: {current time}

Server side can reconstruct the salted hash, and replay attack wont work, because the salted hash will become invalid once it is outside the range of the date field, although this also means if a genuine client sents wrong time, server will reject it.
nonce also ensures that salted hash is valid for each request only once,i.e., if I send 2 requests within same second, nonce will be different

3.OAuth(2)

-------
For pagination, dont use direct paginiation, use resource identifier and potentially order filter

Use rel attribute to show client what a link does. For predefined rel types, if you use it, make sure API behaves per definition

Non-standard rel types must be a URI

For long running asynch ops, return 202 (Accepted) and temporary resource inside the location header

If user tries to get the temporary resource after actual resource is created, return 303 (see other) and actual resource in the location header. Return 410 (gone) if the temp resource expired
