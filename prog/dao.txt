Components

1. a Database type representing DB, this is often manages the connection/session pool and thus, needs to be thread safe

2. a Dao itself, which accepts the DB instance, this layer handles data serialization/deserialization, the interface exposed will be of
domain type

3. a repository may have multiple Daos, which is responsible for translates the complex domain objects into Daos. Note this repository is in
the sense of DDD
